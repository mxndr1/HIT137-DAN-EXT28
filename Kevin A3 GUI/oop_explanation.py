OOP Concepts used in this project:
1. Encapsulation: The AIModel class encapsulates the pipeline logic.
2. Inheritance: TextClassificationModel and TextGenerationModel inherit from AIModel.
3. Polymorphism: Different subclasses implement different run methods.
4. Method Overriding: Subclasses override the run method of the parent class.
5. Decorators: The log_action function in utils.py uses a decorator to log actions.
